# MDB-Socials

## Contributers: Geo and James

With more and more applications trying to connect people to other people and ease the task of figuring out nearby events, my teammate and I created a mobile app that allows members of groups to post and RSVP to social events. Using Xcode Storyboards and programming in Swift, the structure of the application is built upon figma design models. Following traditional MVC practice and adhering to stylistic guides presented in the Swift Documentation, we explored new ways of project development with XCode, such as using multiple storyboards to prevent git merge conflicts. In our project, users are able to interact with a real time database in Firebase, with each information of events and users tracked using Firebase Storage for non-primitive values in our backend data storage/retrieval.
